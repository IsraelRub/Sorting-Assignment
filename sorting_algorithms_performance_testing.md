# README: Sorting Algorithms Performance Testing

This Python program allows you to test and compare the performance of various sorting algorithms using different types of input lists. It also provides graphical and printed outputs to visualize the efficiency of each algorithm in terms of comparisons, initializations, and total operations.

## Features

1. **Sorting Algorithms Supported**:
   - Quick Sort
   - Merge Sort
   - Insertion Sort
   - Heap Sort

2. **List Types for Testing**:
   - Sorted List
   - Reverse Sorted List
   - List with Equal Numbers Values
   - List with Random Integers (With Duplicates)
   - List with Random Floats (Unique Likely)

3. **Testing Options**:
   - Performance analysis with graphs for comparisons, initializations, or total operations.
   - Printed results for predefined test cases with detailed performance comparison.

## How to Use the Code

### 1. **Import the Necessary Modules**
The script uses the following libraries:
- `random` for generating random numbers.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for plotting performance graphs.
- `merge_sort`, `quick_sort`, `insertion_sort`, `heap_sort` (ensure you have implementations for these sorting algorithms in your project).
  
Ensure you have these imported and available.

### 2. **Sorting Algorithms Dictionary** (`sorting_algorithms`)
The `sorting_algorithms` dictionary maps algorithm names to their corresponding sorting functions. The dictionary supports:
- Quick Sort
- Merge Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Heap Sort

Each function takes a list of integers and returns a tuple: `(comparisons, initializations)`.

### 3. **List Types Dictionary** (`dict_of_list_types`)
This dictionary defines five types of lists to test the sorting algorithms on:
- **Sorted**: A list of integers from 0 to `size`.
- **Reverse Sorted**: A list of integers from `size` down to 0.
- **Equal Numbers**: A list where every element is the same number (`1234.567`).
- **Random Integers (With Duplicates)**: A list of random integers in a specified range.
- **Random Floats (Unique Likely)**: A list of random floats.

Each list type can be generated by calling the corresponding function in the dictionary with a specified size.

### 4. **Testing a Single Sorting Algorithm on Multiple List Types** (`test_single_sorting_on_list_types`)
This function allows you to test a specific sorting algorithm on multiple list types:
```python
test_single_sorting_on_list_types(sort_name: str, list_size: int) -> None
```
- `sort_name`: The name of the sorting algorithm (e.g., "Quick Sort").
- `list_size`: The size of the list to be tested.

Example usage:
```python
test_single_sorting_on_list_types("Quick Sort", 1000)
```
This will test Quick Sort on all the different list types with a size of 1000.

### 5. **Graphical Performance Analysis** (`test_sorting_algorithms_with_graphs`)
This function generates performance graphs comparing the different sorting algorithms based on a specified metric (comparisons, initializations, or total operations).
```python
test_sorting_algorithms_with_graphs(size: int, metric: str = "total") -> None
```
- `size`: The size of the list for which to generate the graph.
- `metric`: The metric to analyze (can be `"comparison"`, `"initialization"`, or `"total"`).

Example usage:
```python
test_sorting_algorithms_with_graphs(1000, "total")
```
This will generate graphs for the sorting algorithms' total operations on lists of size 1000.

### 6. **Testing Sorting Algorithms on Predefined Test Cases** (`test_sorting_algorithms_with_prints`)
This function tests the sorting algorithms on predefined lists and prints the results, including the number of comparisons, initializations, total operations, and whether the list was sorted correctly.
```python
test_sorting_algorithms_with_prints() -> None
```
It runs tests on the following predefined test cases:
- Sorted list
- Reverse sorted list
- List with duplicates
- Mixed floats and integers
- Positive numbers
- Mixed positive and negative numbers
- Negative numbers only
- Equal Numbers numbers
- Small list
- Medium and large random integer lists

Example usage:
```python
test_sorting_algorithms_with_prints()
```

### 7. **Interpretation of Output**
- **Graphical Output**: The program generates a graph showing the performance of each sorting algorithm for different list types, where the x-axis represents the list size and the y-axis represents the number of operations (comparisons, initializations, or total).
- **Printed Output**: For each test case, the program prints the number of comparisons, initializations, total operations, and whether the algorithm sorted the list correctly. It also prints the most efficient algorithm for each test case.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
- `matplotlib` for graph plotting:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib
  ```

Additionally, ensure that the sorting algorithm functions (`quick_sort`, `merge_sort`, `insertion_sort`, `heap_sort`) are implemented and available in your project.

## Conclusion

This program is an excellent tool for comparing the performance of different sorting algorithms on various types of input data. You can visualize the performance metrics, compare different algorithms, and choose the most efficient one for your needs.
